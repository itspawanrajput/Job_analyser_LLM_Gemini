# AI Job Analyzer

This project is an AI-powered job analyzer that scrapes job postings from the web, analyzes them against your resume, and provides a ranked list of the most relevant opportunities.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd job_analyzer
    ```
3.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1.  Make sure your resume file is up-to-date. The path is currently set in `main.py` to `/Users/itspawanrajput/Desktop/Pawan_Rajput_AI_Data_Engineer.html`. You can update this path if needed.

2.  Run the main script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

The script will then scrape job postings, analyze them, and print a ranked list of jobs to the console.
